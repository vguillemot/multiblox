There is an actual need of pronostic factors to cluster the patients diagnosed under the same pathology into different clinically relevant subgroups. Cox models have been used for decades to perform this task with more or less efficiency. With the advent of high throughput molecular data, variable selection has become a cornerstone of prediction model design and some L1-norm based Cox model methods have been favorably assessed [bovelstad_predicting_2007, bovelstad_survival_2009, goeman_l1_2010].\r\n\r\nNowadays, more and more oncological studies involve multimodal genomic assays along with rich phenotypes from patient files and/or imaging, arising the issue of integrating these heterogeneous data to predict an outcome. In this work, we propose a multiblock approach, based on the RGCCA framework (Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis) [Tenenhaus2011]. This approach enables to handle at the same time with several high and low dimensional datasets (blocks), to take into account the correlation structure between blocks and to select the best shrinkage parameter for each block. This would lead to better prediction performances and better interpretability of the output model.\r\n\r\nWe tested different combinations of monoblock/shrinkage settings using Coxnet [simon2011regularization] and compared the performances with our integrated multibock elastic-net approach, named Multiblox. We conducted the analyses on three different datasets : a in-house dataset on pediatric high grade glioma, and two datasets from the TCGA.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
